Salutations! 

  This unguided lab was a big project as part of the final for my course Emerging Technologies in Cybersecurity. 
  This project has taught me how to be very analytical and patient when it comes to analyzing large files of network traffic logs, 
  identifying any vulnerable ports that are open, and coming up with solutions or alternatives to eliminate or mitigate the risk.

  In this lab I discovered several vulnerabilities such as open ports HTTP 80, FTP 21 and LDAP 389 these ports are unsecure and therefore 
  should be blocked to prevent any potential intrusions. Furthermore, while using Zenmap I discovered that one of the hosts on the network was 
  using windows 7 OS which is an OS that has reached its end of life and no longer recieves security updates therefore highly vulnerable to attacks. 

  I provide further detail and images to my work in the C844-Task 1 file I included.
