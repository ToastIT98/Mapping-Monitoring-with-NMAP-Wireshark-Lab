Salutations! 

  This unguided lab was a big project as part of the final for my course Emerging Technologies in Cybersecurity. 
  This project has taught me how to be very analytical and patient when it comes to analyzing large files of network traffic logs, 
  identifying any vulnerable ports that are open, and coming up with solutions or alternatives to eliminate or mitigate the risk.
